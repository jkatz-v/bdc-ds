                    <strong>Rachel Sampeck</strong> dreamed of launching a blog, and after some online business coaching from Bet-David Consulting, she made that dream come true.
                    <br><br>
                    “I am in the investment phase of learning as much as I can, so I have not made any revenue, but I am getting in the right rooms to learn, see, and build my future,” Rachel says, noting that changing her mindset was crucial to moving forward with her dreams. “I was almost discouraged after being in the room with big hitters because it felt like a huge mountain to climb to get to where they are.

                    <br><br>
                    “However, working with Antonio taught me that everyone starts somewhere, and it's better to be in the room with people who have a proven track record and to be looking forward to what's possible. It's also taught me to be very thoughtful about my own role in the business I want to build and the key roles to have alongside me to make the dream possible,” Rachel notes, adding, “It reminds me of the quote: 'If you are the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room,' or, in my case, 'if you're intimidated by the people in the room, you're in the exact right room!’”
